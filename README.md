# INF 655 VA Frontend Web Devlopement II Final Project
Created by: Ethan Hernandez-Santiago
This project is supposed to be an app that users can create groups of flashcards over any subject. They can then study with the flashcards inside the groups, or test their knowledge witha  quiz.

## Set Up Information 
This app used the following packages:

React-Router-Dom (for routing)

```npm install react-router-dom```


Tailwind Css (for styling)

```npm install tailwindcss```


Firebase (for authentication, database, and hosting)

```npm install firebase```


react-icons (for icons used in site)

```npm install react-icons```


Uuid (for giving items a unique id)

```npm install uuid```


## Notes

After logging in, if you refresh the page it will cause an error. To fix this, just head back to the home route. Also, if the log in information is wrong, there will be no error. I tried adding one, but nothing seemed to work. 

The reason there is only one commit for everthing is becasue I only added the code to github once the project was finished. This was because I was locked out of my account for a while. I had to wait for GitHub to send me a email. 

Also, if you there is a one account that all ready has flashcards created for testing purpose for it.
